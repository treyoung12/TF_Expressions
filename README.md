# TF_Expressions
Details how different expressions work in Terraform 

Goes into detail regarding string templates, for expressions, splats, dynamic blocks, and version constraints/progressive versioning

-  For the "String_templates" folder, you can get your results by typing **Terraform Output** in the console

The folders are missing the ".terraform" and the ".lock" files, because these files are too large for github. Please use your own environment variables and commit with command "terraform init" to get your own .terraform and .lock files.
